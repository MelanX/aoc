Written in [METAFONT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont).

Enter the puzzle input and then `end` to compute a result. Because METAFONT performs arithmetic on multiples of `1/655536` you have to multiply the result by `65536` yourself, METAFONT would overflow in trying to do so. If your installation of METAFONT complains about `METAFONT capacity exceeded`, you can try running `mflua` instead.
